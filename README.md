# Lengaburu-Traffic

## Problem Context

Our problem is set in the traffic snarls of planet Lengaburu. After the recent Falicornian war, victorious King<br>
Shan of Lengaburu wishes to tour his kingdom. But the traffic in Lengaburu is killing. You should see how Silk<br>
Dorb gets jammed in the evening!<br>
Write code to help King Shan navigate Lengaburu's traffic.<br>

King Shan wants to visit the suburb of Hallitharam, and has 2 possible orbits and 3 possible vehicles to choose from.<br>
Code to determine which orbit and vehicle King Shan should take to reach Hallitharam the fastest.<br>

Orbit options:
Orbit 1 - 18 mega miles & 20 craters to cross
Orbit 2 - 20 mega miles & 10 craters to cross

Vehicle options:
Bike - 10 megamiles/hour & takes 2 min to cross 1 crater
Tuktuk - 12 mm/hour & takes 1 min to cross 1 crater
Car - 20 mm/hour & takes 3 min to cross 1 crater

Weather conditions (affects the number of craters in an orbit):
Sunny - craters reduce by 10%. Car, bike and tuktuk can be used in this weather.
Rainy - craters increase by 20%. Car and tuktuk can be used in this weather.
Windy - no change to number of craters. Car and bike can be used in this weather.
